some useful git commands (see git manual for full set):

git status    gives status of all modified already committed and
              all not yet comitted files (some of the latter might
              not be committed on purpose)

git log       lists commit logs of all commits, mpost recent first
              (see also history_and_todo.txt for more compact doc)
